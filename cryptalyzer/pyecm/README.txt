HOW TO RUN PYECM:

ALL PLATFORMS:
- First, make sure python (>= 2.3) is installed and working. You can always get
the latest release from http://python.org
- For speed increases, you may optionally install gmpy and/or psyco. Both are
highly recommended, especially gmpy, as they result in massive speed increases.
UNIX, LINUX, MAC:
- You can either use python pyecm.py to run it or change the filename to pyecm
and execute it as a script.

WINDOWS:
- Just run pyecm.py as you would any other python program.
