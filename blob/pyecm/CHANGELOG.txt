2.0.2
   - Now supports gmpy2, as well as gmpy.

2.0.1
   - Fixed minor bug with factoring negative numbers on the command-line.

2.0
   - Made asymptotic improvements at the expense of a constant factor. It
should now be faster for numbers greater than 30 or so digits but slower
for numbers less than that.
   - Added ability to type expressions instead of plain numbers. For example,
the program will now factor "2^30-1" instead of making you type "1073741823".
   - Added capability to run pyecm in parallel.
   - Added command line switches, such as a verbose mode and an ability to
select sigma (an internal parameter) randomly.
   - Improved compatibility with installations lacking gmpy and/or psyco.

1.2.2:
   - Made pyecm a tiny bit faster
   - Fixed the bug where the version is reported incorrectly as 1.2
   - Included the GPL with the source

1.2.1:
   - Fixed a silly typo in fastprime. This should make it a little bit faster.
   - Removed silly spaces after lines

1.2:
   - pyecm now uses gmpy if it's installed on your system (highly recommended:
HUGE speed increase when used). If it's not installed, it continues as normal.

   - Silly bug with not using psyco fixed
